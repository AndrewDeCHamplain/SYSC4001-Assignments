Course Description and Objectives: 
The intent of this course is to provide a thorough discussion of the fundamentals of operating 
system (OS) design, and to relate these to contemporary design issues and current directions in 
the development of operating systems. The objective is to provide you with a solid understanding 
of the key mechanisms of modern operating systems, the types of design tradeoffs and decisions 
involved in OS design, and the context within which the operating system functions (hardware, 
other system programs, application programs, interactive users). 
 
Topics to be discussed include: Introduction to operating system, history, structure of an 
operating system; processes, threads, and concurrency; memory management; CPU scheduling; 
and file management.
